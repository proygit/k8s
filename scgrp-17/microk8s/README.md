# Disclaimer( microk8s folder ) 
* The helm folder contains helm chart for the stateless part but it misses some configuration hence we use yaml files from k8s to deploy
* The frontend and the api folder is forked from another team menber who worked on it but it was needed for the presentation video hence they are here with minor changes needed for the presentation
* The final verion of **api** and **frontend** is mentioned in the overleaf document to view.It is from a diffetrent repository.
